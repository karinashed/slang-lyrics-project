Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)<br />
Now we've been through a lot of things<br />
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)<br />
He lives in a lot of things<br />
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)<br />
Been through a lot of things<br />
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)</p>
<p>Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'<br />
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin'<br />
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus)<br />
I watched so many people leave (Lord)<br />
I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's seasonin'<br />
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in<br />
I know I made a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)<br />
But lately, I've been losin' all my deepest friends (Lord)<br />
And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end<br />
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there<br />
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)<br />
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)<br />
And while I introduce the party, you say it's up there<br />
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions<br />
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)<br />
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)<br />
Mama, you was the life of the party<br />
I swear you brought life to the party<br />
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)<br />
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)<br />
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me<br />
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army<br />
'Cause they been killin' ... since ... was watchin' Barney (Jesus)<br />
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)<br />
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here<br />
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here<br />
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)<br />
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)<br />
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears<br />
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?<br />
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)<br />
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)<br />
You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic<br />
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic<br />
And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)<br />
And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)<br />
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid<br />
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it<br />
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)<br />
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)<br />
Baby shower time, father didn't show up<br />
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up<br />
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)<br />
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)<br />
And she's still dependent on her mom<br />
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun<br />
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)<br />
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)<br />
Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?<br />
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)<br />
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)<br />
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side<br />
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes<br />
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)<br />
Even let him get the last meal<br />
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)<br />
He gotta show him that it's that real<br />
He ran up on him with the pipe like, "... stand still" (Jesus)<br />
"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (Lord)<br />
"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ"<br />
He said, "Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ"<br />
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)</p>
<p>Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)</p>
<p>[Jay Electronica:]<br />
Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)<br />
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)<br />
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)<br />
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)<br />
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor<br />
Back from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)<br />
I never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)<br />
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda<br />
Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)<br />
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)<br />
In Tenochtitlan, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)<br />
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal<br />
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local<br />
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)<br />
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)<br />
I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel<br />
My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne<br />
But when you great, they wanna say you took a L, José Castille (Jesus)<br />
I'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)<br />
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears<br />
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier<br />
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)<br />
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)</p>
<p>[Kanye West:]<br />
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)<br />
Now we've been through a lot of things<br />
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)<br />
He lives in a lot of things<br />
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)<br />
Been through a lot of things<br />
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)</p>
<p>[Larry Hoover Jr. (Kanye West):]<br />
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr<br />
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office<br />
You might not have been the only one that could've did that<br />
But you were the one that did do that<br />
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight<br />
You know, to me, it kinda feels like<br />
Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids<br />
Have all been incarcerated through this journey<br />
And we haven't even been to jail<br />
We have been looked at and treated as criminals<br />
For being a part of this family<br />
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in<br />
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)<br />
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him<br />
And it is what made the children of today<br />
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one<br />
My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world<br />
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples<br />
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction<br />
Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years<br />
Man, he would be dead to me<br />
I didn't sign up for that<br />
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that<br />
All my life, man<br />
I've been waitin' for my father to come home<br />
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home<br />
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home<br />
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home<br />
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated<br />
He still not home<br />
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'<br />
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren<br />
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather<br />
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us<br />
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community<br />
Who deserves to breathe free air<br />
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)</p>
