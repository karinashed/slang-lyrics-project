        THE TOP MUSIC CHARTS ARE DRIPPING WITH SLANG

       Analyzing the lyrics of popular songs to measure the rise of modern slang.

        <p>By Karina Shedrofsky  |  July 12, 2023  |  <a href="https://github.com/karinashed/slang-lyrics-project" target="_blank"><u>Github</u></a></p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">
          Call me cheugy (chew-gee), but I'm fascinated by the completely made up words that have come to permeate our lives.
          Cheugy, by the way, refers to the "opposite of trendy," according to the authority on all things slang, <a href ="https://www.urbandictionary.com/"> Urban Dictionary.</a> 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I was interested in learning about when today's slang words emerged and grew in popularity, 
          so I analyzed their presence in popular music over the years. I looked at the lyrics of every song that made it 
          to the weekly top charts between 2010 and 2022, 
          according to <a href="https://musicchartsarchive.com/" target="_blank"><u>Music Charts Archive</u></a>, and 
          searched for every mention of the following popular slang terms: lit, drip, dope, woke, bae, and flex.
        </p>
        
        <div class="subhead">First Thing's First: What Does it All Mean?</div>
        
        <div class="text-box">
          <p class="indented-paragraph">
            <span class="lora-font">drip:</span> Very swag and cool
          </p>
        
          <p class="indented-paragraph">
            <span class="lora-font">lit:</span> When something is turned up or popping ...
          </p>
        
          <p class="indented-paragraph">
            <span class="lora-font">dope:</span> Saying something is cool...
          </p>
        
          <p class="indented-paragraph">
            <span class="lora-font">woke:</span> When an individual becomes more aware of social injustice...
          </p>
        
          <p class="indented-paragraph">
            <span class="lora-font">bae:</span> An acronym that stands for "before anyone else," or a shortened version ofs babe...

          <p class="indented-paragraph">
            <span class="lora-font">flex:</span> Showing off your valuables in a non-humble way...

          The analysis shows the inclusion of these words in popular songs has grown over the years, 
          which likely reflects their rising popularity. Take the word 'drip', for example. 
          The chart below shows that none of the songs featured the word in 2010, but by 2020, 
          that number rose to 17. The counts fluctuate a bit year after year, but we can see a similar 
          trend for most other words tested.  'Woke', however, seems to have had its moment in 2016.

        </script></p>
    

    
    
        <p class="paragraph">
          'Bae' didn't make it to the charts until 2014, but then climbed its way into 13 top songs by 2021. 
          All of the words chosen are slang words, but can also be used in other contexts, making the analysis a bit tricky. 
          We can see in the above chart that 'lit', for instance, first appeared on the charts in 2010, but it was in the song ”Fireflies” by Owl City:
        </p>
   
        <p class="blockquote">You would not believe your eyes <br>
          If ten million fireflies <br>
          Lit up the world as I fell asleep</p> 

          
        <p class="paragraph">
          They clearly meant that the fireflies illuminated the sky, and not that they were "turned up or popping." 
        <p>

        <p>
          That said, 'bae' is actually the best slang word to look at here because it's original and can't be used in another context. 
          'Bae' wasn't brought onto the charts until 2014, and the two songs that got it there were Fifth Harmony's “Bo$$” and Pharrell Wiliams' “Come Get It Bae”.
          Its rise in popularity took a while, but eventually 'bae' was featured in 13 songs by 2021.
        </p> 
           
        <p>
          I didn't only check how many top songs simply mention the word 'bae', but I also took a look at <i>how often</i> 
          the word was mentioned each year. Despite being featured in only two songs in 2014, the word 'bae' made its presence known
          with a total of 10 mentions in those songs.
          Unsurprisingly, “Come Get It Bae” accounted for 9 of those 10 mentions.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
        
        The songs analyzed were from the <i>weekly</i> top 50 charts over the years, which means I looked at more than 600 weekly charts between 2010 and 2022.
        For the sake of the slang analysis, I counted each song once per year as long as it made it onto the charts at all, but some songs kept showing up, week after week.
        The majority of songs lasted fewer than five weeks, but many held on much longer.
        The graph below breaks it down.

        <p class="paragraph"> Nine songs featured on more than 60 weekly charts, which means they lasted more than 15 months. 
          The winner is The Weekend's "Blinding Lights", which was among the 50 most popular songs for a whopping 86 weeks. 
          In this song, however, he doesn't once mention the word lit, drip, dope, woke, bae, or flex... </p>
